You hear a voice call down from the sky
It booms, "I heard you asked for help.
I'm going to tell you a list of commands.
If you need help with a specific one say 'help' then the command you want to use
The commands are as follows:
go
look
attack
quit
restart
reroll
check
drop
take
equip
unequip
pause
unpause
help

There, I hope that helps. 
Now will you please leave me alone?
I'm very busy, you know."
